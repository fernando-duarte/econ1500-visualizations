International trade, particularly between the North American countries of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
Understanding the breakdown of international trade in different states of the U.S. and present a visualization 
of the benefits and drawbacks of free trade to different U.S. states. Focus on the potential for tariffs and 
how those would affect the trade conditions and economic indicators of different states.

An interactive online tool that shows the current balance of trade for each U.S. State with Mexico and Canada. 
States color-coded based on their balance of trade with these two countries. States with a negative balance 
of trade with Mexico and Canada (i.e. they have more imports than exports) will be red, and states with a positive 
balance of trade will be green.

Interactive sliders will show a general tariff rate for trade between Mexico, the US, and Canada, assuming that 
the tariffs are reciprocated. This will allow users to adjust hypothetical tariff rates and project how these 
tariff rates would affect the trade situation in each state.

Data will include the current dollar balance of trade data for all 50 U.S. States, along with the most important 
exports and imports for certain states. Special attention to particularly interesting industries or circumstances 
affecting one state. Tariff levels will range from 0% to at least 50%.

Data sources include the WTO, United States Trade Representative, and trade.gov.

The decline of manufacturing capacity has had huge externalities in the Rust Belt and certain New England cities, 
where the social order has been almost completely decimated by the exodus of factory jobs. Cities such as Lawrence, 
Massachusetts and Lowell, Massachusetts have been hard-hit by the closure of mills. The effects are even worse in 
certain Midwestern cities like Detroit, MI or Albany, NY.

Increased globalization has not brought equal prosperity to different regions. The growth of the technological 
sector has been concentrated in places like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, bringing sky-high housing costs, 
yet other regions seem to have been left behind.

    This visualization tool analyzes the North American trade proposal text to identify key topics and their relationships.
    
    - **Word Cloud**: Shows the most frequent terms scaled by their importance
    - **Network Graph**: Displays connections between related terms that appear close together in the text
    
    The visualization helps identify important themes such as trade balances, tariffs, economic impacts on different states,
    and the relationship between the United States, Mexico, and Canada in the context of international trade.
